# obi-skills

Agent Skills for the Open Brain Institute (OBI) platform — reusable instructions that teach AI agents how to authenticate, link results, keep scientific logbooks, and drive OBI APIs (data integration, circuit simulation, single-cell / ion-channel modeling, skeletonization, visualization, and related workflows).

Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format and live under [`skills/`](./skills/). Install or symlink them into your agent’s skills directory (e.g. `.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.kiro/skills/`), or point your tool at this folder.

Example install with the skills CLI (if you use it):

```bash
npx skills add openbraininstitute/obi-skills
```

# Claude plugin

The `open-brain-institute` plugin bundles all skills above with the production OBI MCP server, registered as `obi` (`https://cell-a.openbraininstitute.org/api/agent-ts/mcp`). (You may also see this server called `neuroagent`; it is the same server.) The plugin is distributed through this repository, which doubles as a plugin marketplace named `obi`.

## Install in Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add openbraininstitute/obi-skills
/plugin install open-brain-institute@obi
```

Or in one step: `/plugin install open-brain-institute --marketplace openbraininstitute/obi-skills`. Skills then appear as `/open-brain-institute:<skill>`, e.g. `/open-brain-institute:obi-logbook`.

## Install in Claude Desktop / Cowork

1. Open **Customize** in the sidebar and select **Plugins**.
2. Select **Add marketplace** and enter `openbraininstitute/obi-skills`.
3. Find **Open Brain Institute** in the list and click **Install**.
4. Open the installed plugin, go to its **Connectors** tab, and connect `obi`. Installing does not sign you in. Sign-in opens in your browser.

## Updating

Third-party marketplaces do not auto-update by default.

- **Claude Code:** run `/plugin`, open the **Marketplaces** tab, select `obi`, and choose **Update marketplace** (or **Enable auto-update**).
- **Claude Desktop / Cowork:** select **Check for updates** on the marketplace, or turn on **Sync automatically**.

## Maintainers

Whenever a skill or the MCP config changes, bump `version` in [`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](./.claude-plugin/plugin.json) in the same PR; installed copies are cached by version. Keep the plugin name `open-brain-institute` so an update replaces the old version instead of adding a second plugin.

To test a branch before merging, run `claude --plugin-dir .` from a checkout, or `/plugin marketplace add openbraininstitute/obi-skills#<branch>`.
